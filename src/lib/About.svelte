  After nearly a decade working as a chef in kitchens ranging from casual
  bistros to Michelin-starred restaurants, I decided to change directions. I
  stumbled upon an online computer science course and was immediately hooked.
  What started as curiosity quickly became a passion as hours and days
  disappeared while I dove deeper into coding.

<br />
<p>
  A few years of self-teaching later I have made the jump to web development and
  joined <strong>Accessify</strong>
  as a <strong>Front-End Developer</strong>. There I work on their B2B SaaS
  platform.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  In addition to my work at Accessify, Iâ€™m expanding my skills toward full-stack
  development by learning a modern backend stack. I also enjoy building websites
  in my free time and am open to freelance opportunities where I can put my
  creativity and technical skills to work. If you have a project in mind, feel
